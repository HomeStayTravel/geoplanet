= geoplanet

A Ruby wrapper for the Yahoo! GeoPlanet APIs. It's inspired on Mattt Thompson's yahoo-geoplanet gem,
but this version supports better usage of matrix and query parameters, uses JSON for API communication to minimize bandwidth usage, supports both short & long versions of a place, and supports multiple languages.

== Usage

=== Searching for a Location:

  require 'geoplanet'
  GeoPlanet.app_id = [Your App ID Here]
  
  # Search for places that matches "Springfield" (the API returns 1 by default)
  Place.search("Springfield")
  
  # Search for *all* places that matches "Springfield"
  Place.search("Springfield", :count => 0)
  
  # You can pass in any Matrix or Query parameters this way too
  # For more details see the following URLs:
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#matrix_parameters
  # http://developer.yahoo.com/geo/guide/resources_and_collections.html#query_parameters
  
=== Initializing by Where On Earth ID && Associations
  
  require 'geoplanet'
  include GeoPlanet
  GeoPlanet.app_id = [Your App ID Here]
  
  cmu = Place.new(23511275) # WoE ID for Carnegie Mellon University
  
  # Everything you get back from the API you have direct access to
  # through the Place object. For example:
  
  cmu.version          # "long"
  cmu.placetype        # "Point of Interest"
  cmu.placetype_code   # 20
  cmu.admin1           # "Pennsylvania"
	cmu.admin1_code      # "US-PA"
	cmu.admin1_placetype # "State"
  cmu.latitude         # 40.444
                       # Latitude and Longitude are values at Centroid
  cmu.bounding_box     # [[40.44445, -79.943314], [40.44355, -79.944511]]
                       # Bounding box are NW / SE coordinates in array
  cmu.admin2           # "Allegheny"
	cmu.admin2_placetype # "County"
  
  # We unlock the true power of GeoPlanet with association collections
  # Check out this truly amazing stuff:
  
  # The containing GeoPlanet entity for CMU
  cmu.parent # "Squirrel Hill North"
  
  # A list of other points of interest in the area
  cmu.siblings.each{|s| puts s} 
  
  # A complete hierarchy, from country down to suburb
  cmu.ancestors.each{|s| puts s}
